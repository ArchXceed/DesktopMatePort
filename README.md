## AI?

Yes, I used a lot AI for this project. (I'm in 2nd year of apprenticeship, and didn't want to learn C for a single project).

I would say... 70% of the code AI generated, but still a lot of human debugging :)

You can check out my other project! (Which are not almost Vibe coded). EPTNet, 3000, ...
